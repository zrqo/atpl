= ATPL NETWORK test page

:page-toc: false

Welcome stranger!

This is a community-built knowledge repository for anyone studying towards the EASE/UK ATPL exams. Here you'll find rough study notes, reference materials, and learning resources contributed by past students.

We also present general guidance emerging from frequent discussions on our Discord server.  

This is a living site and all community members are invited to contribute their own notes and proposed amendments and additions.

This test repository has been built using Antora.  All content lives on GitHub.  If you wish to add something or fix mistakes, you may fork the repository, then suggest changes back to us through a pull request.  Alternatively suggestions may be made on the Discord server.

This site runs on a FreeBSD jail so ZFS snapshots can be provided on request.  It is not dependent on third-party hosting platforms.
