+------------------------------------------------------------+
Time starts from end of flight / event unless stated.

60 DAYS

* Flight recorder (accident). "Flight recorder" = 2 words = 2 months ≈ 60 days.

3 MONTHS (≈ 90 days)

* Operational flight plan ("operational flight plan")
* Mass and balance / loadsheet
* Dangerous goods docs
* Special loads
  Mnemonic: "3 words 3 months" = Mass and Balance, Operational Flight Plan, Dangerous Goods (dangerous goods is 2 words but lives in that set on exams anyway)

15 MONTHS

* Crew member experience records (logged experience)

24 MONTHS (2 years)

* Flight duty records

36 MONTHS (3 years)

* Aircraft technical log
* Training records (including DG training)
* Crew member training + checking records
* Personal / technical records
  Mnemonic: "Aircraft Technical Log" = 3 words = 3 years

CRITICAL HOOKS

* They love "aircraft technical log" = 36 months
* They love "operational flight plan" = 3 months
* Cockpit voice recorder / flight data recorder timing → see Section 8

+------------------------------------------------------------+
| 2. DUTY LIMITS / FDP / STANDBY / FLIGHT TIME LIMITS        |
+------------------------------------------------------------+
DUTY PERIOD LIMITS (total duty, not just flight)
(1) 60 duty hrs in any 7 consecutive days
(2) 110 duty hrs in any 14 consecutive days
(3) 190 duty hrs in any 28 consecutive days

FLIGHT TIME LIMITS (actual block time)

* 100 hrs in any 28 consecutive days
* 900 hrs in a calendar year
* 1000 hrs in any 12 consecutive calendar months

FDP (FLIGHT DUTY PERIOD)

* Basic maximum FDP can be extended by max 1 hour
* Unforeseen circumstances: commander can extend up to 3 hours
* Max basic daily FDP (before extensions): 13 h
  With approved extension: goes to 15 h
  Without extension: 13 h
* Rest away from home base: ≥10 h or as long as previous duty, whichever is greater
* Night duty window: 02:00-04:59 (home-base body clock)
* Window of circadian low (WOCL): 02:00-05:59

STANDBY CREDIT

* Standby at airport = 100% counted as duty
* Standby at home = 25% counted as duty

CONSECUTIVE DUTY ACCUMULATION

* Same 60 / 110 / 190 hr caps apply across combined FDP + standby credit

READ THIS LIKE AN EXAM:

* FDP extendable 1 h by schedule
* FDP extendable 3 h by commander discretion due to "unforeseen"
* Daily FDP 13 h basic / 15 h maxed
* Night duty lives in 02:00-04:59

SO IF THEY ASK:
"How far can commander extend FDP in unforeseen circumstances?"
Answer: 3 hours

SO IF THEY ASK:
"How long can a planned FDP be extended under approved scheme?"
Answer: 1 hour

STANDBY TRAP:
Airport standby counts fully as duty time

+------------------------------------------------------------+
| 3. CHECKS / RECENCY / COMMAND UPGRADE                      |
+------------------------------------------------------------+
VALIDITIES

* OPC (Operator Proficiency Check): 6 months
  Note: may be 12 months in certain specialised ops, but 6 months is standard airline
* LPC (Licence Proficiency Check): 12 months
* Line Check: 12 months
* Senior Cabin Crew authorization: 12 months

COMMAND COURSE (multi-crew)

* Training in FSTD (includes LOFT) and/or aircraft line training
* Operator Proficiency Check
* Command responsibilities training
* 10 sectors line training as commander under supervision

COMMAND (single pilot ops)
VFR route to command:

* 500 hrs (or an IR)
  IFR route to command:
* 700 hrs total of which >400 hrs PIC
  and >100 hrs IFR

RECENT EXPERIENCE (to carry pax etc.)
CAT operations:

* 3 takeoffs, 3 approaches, 3 landings in last 90 days

IFR recency:

* 50 hrs IFR of which 10 hrs PIC
* 5 IFR flights + 3 instrument approaches in last 90 days

Night recency:

* 15 hrs night (can be part of the 50 above)
* 3 T/O + 3 landings at night in last 90 days

PILOT IS "INEXPERIENCED" UNTIL:

* 100 flight hours AND 10 sectors within 120 consecutive days (consolidation window)
  OR
* 150 flight hours AND 20 sectors (no time limit on consolidation)

READ THIS LIKE AN EXAM:

* "90 days rule" = pax carriage, IFR, and night checks
* "inexperienced" definition is about consolidation (100/10 in 120 days OR 150/20 anytime)

+------------------------------------------------------------+
| 4. APPROACHES / MINIMA / VISUAL REFERENCE                  |
+------------------------------------------------------------+
APPROACH TYPES

1. Non-Precision Approach (NPA) = Type A
2. APV (Approach with Vertical guidance) / CAT I style
3. Precision Approach (ILS etc.) = Type B
4. Circling (circling is its own animal)

CAT I / CAT II / CAT III
CAT I:

* DH 200 ft
* RVR 550 m

CAT II:

* DH 100 ft
* RVR 300 m

CAT IIIA:

* DH <100 ft (or 100 ft) and RVR 200 m
  (often given as DH 100 ft / RVR 200 m)

CAT IIIB:

* No DH (or DH <50 ft)
* RVR 75 m possible only with fail-operational rollout guidance
* If only fail-passive, min RVR typically 150 m
* CAT IIIB no DH with full fail-operational = you basically don't need outside cues

APPROACH VISUAL REFERENCE REQUIRED
(what you actually must be able to see at DA/DH/MDA to continue)

* NPA / APV / CAT I:
  Need to see runway, markings, or basically any relevant light
  (approach lights, threshold, etc.)

* CAT II:
  Need a segment of 3 consecutive lights, including at least 1 lateral element
  (lateral = crossbar / TDZ / edge)

* CAT IIIA or IIIB (fail-passive):
  Need 3 consecutive lights. No lateral element required here.

* CAT IIIB (fail-operational WITH DH):
  Need to see 1 centerline light

* CAT IIIB (NO DH, true autoland / rollout guidance):
  No specified visual reference required

READ THIS LIKE AN EXAM:
If they show "CAT IIIB no DH": answer "no external visual reference required"

PLANNING vs DISPATCH vs OPERATING MINIMA

* Planning stage: use planning minima = forecast weather +/- 1 hour around ETA
* Dispatch stage: compare with planning minima (not actual)
* In-flight / approach: you use operating minima (actual RVR/cloud now)

PRECISION vs NON-PRECISION BASIC MEMORY

* Precision (DA/H) ~200 ft, RVR 800 m in the generic/regulatory style table
* Non-precision (MDA/H) ~400 ft, RVR 1500 m
  "To go NPA from PA you roughly double" is the mental shortcut

FACILITY-LIMITED LOWEST MDH/DH (ft) THEY LOVE ASKING:

* LOC with/without DME: 250 ft
* VOR/DME: 250 ft
* VOR only: 300 ft
* NDB/DME: 300 ft
* NDB only: 350 ft

READ THIS LIKE AN EXAM:
NDB alone always worst (350 ft)
LOC/DME best (250 ft)

+------------------------------------------------------------+
| 5. ALTERNATES / ETOPS / DISPATCH RULES                     |
+------------------------------------------------------------+
TAKE-OFF ALTERNATE
Twin engine (non-ETOPS):

* Must be within 60 min (one engine inoperative cruise speed)

Twin engine (ETOPS approved):

* Can go out to 120 min

3 or 4 engines:

* 120 min

EXAM TRAP:
If you see "180 minutes" and "120 minutes" in the answers:

* You pick 120 min, because 180 is not standard take-off alternate, that's long-range diversion stuff.
  If you do NOT see 180, you'll probably pick 60 min (twin non-ETOPS)

DESTINATION ALTERNATE

* "destination alternate -- 2"
  Meaning: Normally 1 destination alternate is needed. But watch wording.
  The shortcut you wrote: destination alternate needs 2 (interpretation: you may need 2 alternates under certain bad-weather / isolated aerodrome / no re-dispatch cases). They like:

  * take-off alternate: 1
  * destination: possibly 2 in certain scenarios

PLANNING MINIMA

* Planning stage uses PLANNING minima (forecast, with time margin)
* Dispatch compares to Planning minima
* Actual approach uses OPERATING minima

LVO OPERATOR PROCEDURES (Low Vis Ops, EU 965/2012)
"MR FLATT"
M  Missed approach
R  Rollout
F  Flare
L  Land
A  Approach
T  Takeoff
T  Taxi
Operator must publish all that

+------------------------------------------------------------+
| 6. BASIC OPS LIMITS: VFR / LIGHTS / CABIN CREW             |
+------------------------------------------------------------+
VFR MINIMA (day VMC in controlled airspace in this memory block style)

* VFR Min: 3000 m vis
* Special VFR Min: 1500 m vis

AT NIGHT
DISPLAYED (what must be ON at night in flight):

* Navigation lights
* Anti-collision lights

EQUIPPED (what must be INSTALLED for night ops):

* Navigation lights
* Anti-collision light(s)
* Two landing lights

CABIN CREW MINIMUM

* 1 cabin crew per each fraction of 50 passenger seats
  Example:
  1-50 pax seats → 1 CC
  51-100 pax seats → 2 CC
  etc.

HAND FIRE EXTINGUISHERS (cabin):
Seats 7-30   -> 1
31-60        -> 2
61-200       -> 3
201-300      -> 4
301-400      -> 5
401-500      -> 6
501-600      -> 7
601+         -> 8
Mnemonic: "1-2-3 then +1 per 100 seats up to max 8"

WAKE TURB SEQUENCING (memorize this, they adore it)
Landing behind a landing Heavy:

* Land BEYOND the Heavy's touchdown point

Landing behind a Heavy taking off:

* Touch down BEFORE the point where the Heavy lifted off

Taking off behind a landing Heavy:

* Lift off BEYOND its touchdown point

Taking off behind a Heavy taking off:

* Lift off BEFORE the Heavy's rotation point (Vr point)

+------------------------------------------------------------+
| 7. OXYGEN / PRESSURISATION / MASKS                         |
+------------------------------------------------------------+
COCKPIT QUICK-DONNING MASKS

* Quick-donning masks required at and above FL250 (25 000 ft)

PASSENGER MASKS

* Masks must automatically drop so pax get oxygen by 15 000 ft cabin altitude

SUPPLEMENTAL OXYGEN RULES (generic EASA memory set)

UNPRESSURISED OPS
Flight crew

* > 10 000 ft cabin altitude: 100% supply available
  > Cabin crew
* After 30 min between 10 000 and 13 000 ft
* 100% above 13 000 ft
  Passengers
* 10% of pax between 10 000 and 13 000 ft
* 100% above 13 000 ft

PRESSURISED OPS (loss of pressurisation case)
Flight crew + cabin crew

* After 30 min between 10 000 and 13 000 ft
* 100% above 13 000 ft
* At least 2 hours of oxygen for crew above 13 000 ft
  Passengers
* After 30 min between 10 000 and 14 000 ft: oxygen for 10% pax
* Between 14 000 and 15 000 ft: oxygen for 30% pax
* Above 15 000 ft: oxygen for 100% pax

CABIN OXYGEN QUANTITY

* "110% for oxygen masks, 100% for life jackets"
  Meaning: provide masks for >100% of pax (extra masks). Life jackets just 1 per pax.

LIFE JACKETS

* Required if >50 nm from shore OR T/O/LDG such that ditching is possible
* One per pax
* Each must have a light

LIFE RAFTS

* Required if >120 min at cruise speed OR >400 nm (whichever is less) from a landing site
* Must include 1 spare raft of the largest rated capacity

+------------------------------------------------------------+
| 8. EQUIPMENT THRESHOLDS / CVR & FDR                        |
+------------------------------------------------------------+
By mass / pax:

≥ 5 700 kg OR >9 pax:

* Airborne weather radar (also required if pressurised)
* EGPWS / TAWS (Terrain Awareness)
  ≥ 5 700 kg:
* Windshield wiper
* Flight Data Recorder (FDR)
  ≥ 5 700 kg OR >19 pax:
* ACAS II / TCAS II

≥ 15 000 kg:

* Flight crew interphone system requirement (cockpit ↔ cabin)

≥ 27 000 kg:

* Flight Monitoring System
* Flight Data Analysis Programme (FOQA-style monitoring)

CRASH AXES / CROWBARS

* 1 crash axe if >5 700 kg AND >9 pax (kept on flight deck)
* 2 crash axes if >200 pax (second one aft in the cabin)

ELT (Emergency Locator Transmitter)
If certified ≤2008:

* ≤19 seats: one ELT (any type is fine)
* > 19 seats: one automatic ELT OR two ELTs of any type

If certified >2008:

* ≤19 seats: one automatic ELT
* > 19 seats: two ELTs, at least one automatic

CVR DURATION (Cockpit Voice Recorder)
Before 1998: 30 min
1998 → 2021: 2 hours
After 2021: 25 hours

FDR REQUIREMENT YEARS

* 1990 → Cockpit Voice Recorder mandatory
* 1998 → Flight Data Recorder mandatory
  (this is the usual exam memory shortcut; the dates line up with wider mandatory carriage rules for transport category)

+------------------------------------------------------------+
| 9. ETOPS / ALTERNATES / OCEANIC CLR / OEI DISTANCE         |
+------------------------------------------------------------+
TAKE-OFF ALTERNATE (already covered in Section 5 but repeat here)

* 2-eng non-ETOPS: within 60 min OEI cruise
* 2-eng ETOPS-approved: within 120 min OEI cruise
* 3/4-eng: 120 min

WITHOUT ETOPS APPROVAL (diversion range class rules)

* Class A: 60 min OEI
* Class B/C: 120 min OEI

REQUEST OCEANIC CLEARANCE

* At least 40 minutes before reaching the oceanic entry point
* Or before departure if leaving from an airport right next to oceanic airspace

MELTING YOUR BRAIN WITH ETOPS ANSWERS
If they throw "180 minutes" alongside "120 minutes":

* You select 120, because 180 is extended-ETOPS stuff, not baseline take-off alternate planning

PRESSURISATION / MASK DROP TRAP
"Quick donning required at 25 000 ft"
"Passenger masks must deploy no later than cabin altitude 15 000 ft"

+------------------------------------------------------------+
| 10. RVSM / CONTINGENCY ALTITUDE OFFSETS / WAKE             |
+------------------------------------------------------------+
LOSS OF SEPARATION / TURB / WAKE AVOIDANCE VERTICAL OFFSET

ABOVE FL410:

* Climb or descend 1000 ft

AT FL410:

* Climb 1000 ft OR descend 500 ft

BELOW FL410:

* Climb or descend 500 ft

Use that table whenever they ask "what vertical offset should you apply?"

RVSM EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS

* Two independent altitude measuring systems (dual ADCs)
* One altitude alerting system
* One automatic altitude hold (autopilot)
* SSR transponder Mode C (altitude reporting)

"I)FR --> (I)ndependent radios"
Meaning: for IFR in controlled airspace you need independent comm/nav radio capability. They toss this as a trivia bullet.

WAKE TURBULENCE SPACING
(Repeated from Section 6 because examiners fetishize this)

* Behind a Heavy:

  * Landing behind Heavy landing: land beyond its touchdown
  * Landing behind Heavy taking off: land before Heavy rotation point
  * Takeoff behind Heavy landing: rotate beyond its touchdown
  * Takeoff behind Heavy takeoff: rotate before Heavy rotation point

+------------------------------------------------------------+
| 11. TERRAIN / MOCA / CLEARANCE / OTHER NUMBERS             |
+------------------------------------------------------------+
MOCA CLEARANCE MARGINS (IFR enroute obstacle clearance mental rule)

* Up to 6000 ft AMSL: MOCA + 1000 ft
* Above 6000 ft AMSL: MOCA + 2000 ft

EN-ROUTE OXYGEN (pressurised vs unpressurised)
Handled in Section 7, but note:
Quick-donning masks compulsory at/above FL250
Passenger supply must allow continued safe flight and landing

RUNWAY CONDITION REPORT / BRAKING
(RWYCC matrix shows up in performance/OPS too, but you listed it under Snowtam separately in another message. When they give you braking "1/1/2" vs "4/4/4":

* "1/1/2" → POOR / POOR / MEDIUM-TO-POOR. That is worse.
* Diversion trigger = worst code, usually "1" or "0".)

+------------------------------------------------------------+
| 12. MANUAL STRUCTURE / ANNEX RESPONSIBILITY                |
+------------------------------------------------------------+
OPERATIONS MANUAL PARTS (GTA style)
Part A  = General / Basic company policies
Part B  = Type specific / Aircraft operating matters
Part C  = Aerodrome / Route info
Part D  = Training

Decision trick:
If it's not type-specific, it belongs in Part A.
If it's airport-specific, Part C.
If it's training syllabi, Part D.

ICAO ANNEXES YOU MUST ASSOCIATE
Annex 1  = Personnel Licensing
Annex 2  = Rules of the Air
Annex 6  = Operation of Aircraft
Annex 10 = Aeronautical Telecommunications / COM
Annex 17 = Security
Annex 18 = Dangerous Goods
Annex 19 = Safety Management

RESPONSIBILITY SPLIT

* Safety management (flight data analysis etc.) = Safety Manager
* Compliance monitoring = Accountable Manager

ANNEX 6 PARTS

* Part I   = CAT (Commercial Air Transport, aeroplanes)
* Part II  = GA (General Aviation, aeroplanes)
* Part III = Helicopters

+------------------------------------------------------------+
| 13. RANDOM HIGH-YIELD TRASH THEY LOVE                      |
+------------------------------------------------------------+
VFR vs SPECIAL VFR

* Normal VFR vis: 3000 m
* Special VFR vis: 1500 m

"WINDOW OF CIRCADIAN LOW"

* 02:00-05:59 home-base body clock
  "Night duty definition"
* 02:00-04:59

QUICK MASKS / OXYGEN DROP

* Quick-donning masks ≥ FL250
* Passenger masks must drop by cabin alt 15 000 ft

ELT REQUIREMENT

* ≤19 seats vs >19 seats, certification year cutoff 2008
  (You already have the table in Section 8)

CABIN CREW MINIMUM

* 1 per fraction of 50 pax seats

FIRE EXTINGUISHERS

* 7-30 seats: 1
* 31-60 seats: 2
* 61-200 seats: 3
* 201-300 seats: 4
* 301-400 seats: 5
* 401-500 seats: 6
* 501-600 seats: 7
* > 600 seats: 8

OXYGEN QUANTITY

* 110% masks
* 100% life jackets

"See 1350 click 1350"

* Use this as a mental red flag. When 1350 shows up in an answer set, it's probably the 1350 number. (Examiner fingerprint bait.)

RUNWAY LIGHTING FOR LVP CONTINUE DECENT (VIS REF)

* NPA / APV / CAT I: any runway or approach lighting / markings good enough
* CAT II: need 3 consecutive lights incl 1 lateral element
* CAT III fail-passive: need 3 consecutive lights (no lateral element required)
* CAT III fail-op with DH: need 1 centerline light
* CAT III no DH (true fail-op autoland/rollout): no visual requirement

MIN RVR / MDA QUICK BLOCK

* Precision: RVR ~800 m, DA/H ~200 ft (generic)
* Non-precision: RVR ~1500 m, MDA/H ~400 ft

RVR EXAM TROLL
"CAT 3B (no DH)" ≈ can continue with zero visual ref because rollout guidance is automatic

ALTERNATE MINIMA BRAINWORM

* Take-off alternate: 60 min (twin non-ETOPS) or 120 min (ETOPS twin / 3-4 eng)
* Destination alternates: may require 2 under some conditions (think: isolated or weather garbage)
* Planning minima vs Operating minima: planning uses forecast ±1h, operating uses actual

FLIGHT DUTY PERIOD SUMMARY CORE LINES

* FDP basic max 13 h
* Planned extension = +1 h
* Commander in unforeseen = +3 h
* Airport standby = 100% duty
* Home standby = 25% duty
* Caps: 60 h / 7 days, 110 h / 14 days, 190 h / 28 days
* Flight time: 100 h / 28 days, 900 h / calendar year, 1000 h / 12 months

PILOT QUAL LIMITS (MIX OF TYPES)
Pilot should not operate more than:

* 3 reciprocating engine types/variants
* 3 turboprop types/variants
* 1 turboprop + 1 piston type/variant
* 1 turboprop + any class of aeroplane
  (So basically you can't be rostered on five random museum pieces at once)

RECENCY 90-DAY RULE

* 3 T/O + 3 LDG + 3 approaches in last 90 days for CAT pax ops
* IFR recency and night recency live inside that same 90-day logic
  They hit this nonstop

RUNWAY CONTAMINATION / RWYCC LINK

* RWYCC 6 = DRY
* RWYCC 5 = GOOD
* RWYCC 4 = GOOD-MEDIUM
* RWYCC 3 = MEDIUM
* RWYCC 2 = MEDIUM-POOR
* RWYCC 1 = POOR
* RWYCC 0 = NIL
  "1/1/2" is worse than "4/4/4"

RVSM OFFSET TABLE (EMERGENCY / WAKE / TURB)

* Above FL410: ±1000 ft
* At FL410: +1000 ft or -500 ft
* Below FL410: ±500 ft

MOCA TERRAIN GUARANTEE

* MOCA +1000 ft up to 6000 ft AMSL
* MOCA +2000 ft above 6000 ft AMSL

GTA MANUAL PARTS (AGAIN, BECAUSE THEY WILL ASK)
A = General
B = Type specific
C = Aerodrome / Route
D = Training

LANDING / TAKEOFF FLAPS (TRICK MEME FROM TYPE QUESTIONS)

* Landing: Flap 30
* Takeoff: Flap 10
  This is airline-type-specific in real life. If they ask in a "generic" ATPL question, it's reportable because it's type-specific, but exam still recycles it. Keep it in back pocket.
